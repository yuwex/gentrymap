# GentryMap

*A project about race in California.*

In this project, I decided to map out what gentrification looks like.

## What is Gentrification?
--------------------------

I emailed Dr. Gonz치les, Ph.D. in Urban Planning, to learn more about gentrification.

She defines Gentrification as a system of change within 4 structures:

* **Demographics**: A shift from families to younger individuals.
* **Race**: An Asian American enclave receiving an increased share of the dominant social group, in the US case this group would be Whites.
* **Income**: A shift from working-class to professionals.
* **Housing prices**: Rent prices in places like Los Angeles that are majority renters. 

Furthermore, she states that Gentrification is not a definite occurrence in communities:

    These systems are usually triggered by some sort of large-scale investment in historically disadvantaged communities that suddenly make a place more attractive (transit investments, green infrastructure, stadiums, etc).

## Is Gentrification Good?
--------------------------

Gentrification is inherently a force that takes from one group and gives to another group. Some people see this change as positive, citing neighborhood value increases and newer businesses and investors. However, Dr. Gonz치les presents another side to these seemingly positive events:

    [Gentrification] is a form of neighborhood change we call upscaling. It's bad because it also generates displacement of long-time and usually vulnerable residents. In Los Angeles, advocates for housing rights have long urged people to use the terms gentrification and displacement together, otherwise, we can easily assume gentrification is good (who wouldn't want their neighborhood to "upscale"?).

## How does this Project Work?
------------------------
This project aims to map out what gentrification looks like. All data was taken from the "U.S. Census American Community Survey: LATINO BY RACE" sheets. The data was filtered by Zipcode and gathered for the years from 2010 to 2020. Then, using the programming language Python and the library Pandas, the data was parsed to only include the relevant information. All code and data is stored in the "project" folder for anyone to look at and use. The data was then compiled and presented with the public version of tableau.

## Sources of Error
-------------------
* The original data contained a margin of error. This was removed from the final map, and the data may be slightly inaccurate due to this.
* As Dr. Gonz치les points out, race is only one piece of gentrification, but this map still contains interesting information.
* The American Community Survey only releases data every five years. The data for non-five-year increments is a projection, and therefore, may be wrong.
